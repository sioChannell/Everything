This demo is developed based on the Brainknows API and OpenAPI. The page has two chat windows: "Agent" and "Ekubo."

In the "Agent" chat window, you can ask for Web3-related information, such as "What is Uniswap?" or request to initiate transactions, such as "swap 1 eth for strk on Starknet." For more details, please refer to [Brainknows Documentation](https://docs.brianknows.org/).

In the "Ekubo" chat window, you can ask for data related to Ekubo, such as "Return the latest governance proposal from Ekubo." All of the data is fetched through the official Ekubo public API. For more details, please refer to [Ekubo API Documentation](https://docs.ekubo.org/integration-guides/reference/ekubo-api).
